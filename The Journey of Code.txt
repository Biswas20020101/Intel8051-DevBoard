Computer language:
A computer language is a way to communicate with computers. 
It’s a set of instructions that tells a computer what to do.
Just like humans use different languages to talk to each other, computers have their own languages that programmers use to write software, websites, apps, and more.


Computer Language level:
There are three main types of computer languages:
           1.Machine Language (Low-Level) – Directly understood by computers (binary code: 0s and 1s).
           2.Assembly Language – A step above machine code, uses simple instructions like MOV or ADD.
           3.High-Level Languages – Easier for humans to read and write (like Python, Java, or C++).



Programming Language:
A programming language is a type of computer language used to write instructions that a computer can understand and execute.
It allows developers to create software, apps, games, websites, and more.

Key Points:
*Purpose: Translates human logic into commands a computer can follow.
*Readable: Uses keywords, symbols, and rules (syntax) that make sense to humans.
*Execution: The code is either compiled (translated all at once) or interpreted (translated line by line).


Examples of Programming Languages:
*Python – Easy to learn, great for beginners.
*JavaScript – Used for websites and web apps.
*C++ – Powerful, used for games and systems programming.
*Java – Common in enterprise software and Android apps.


Programming Language Level:
Programming languages are often categorized by their level of abstraction – how closely they interact with computer hardware. Here's a breakdown:

   1.Low-Level Languages.
      *Close to hardware – Directly interacts with the computer’s CPU and memory.
      *Fast and efficient but harder for humans to read.

   Examples:-Machine Language – Binary (0s and 1s).
            -Assembly Language – Uses mnemonics like MOV, ADD

   2. Middle-Level Languages.
       *Balances hardware control and readability.
       *Can perform system-level tasks but with simpler syntax than low-level languages.
Examples:

   *C – Often called a "middle-level" language because it can be used for system programming and application development.
   *C++ – Extends C with more features (object-oriented programming).

   3. High-Level Languages
       *Human-friendly – Abstracted from hardware details.
       *Easier to write, read, and maintain but slightly slower than low-level languages.
Examples:

   *Python – Simple and readable.
   *Java – Portable and widely used.
   *JavaScript – Runs in browsers for web development.

   4. Very High-Level Languages
       *Extremely abstracted – Focuses on solving problems without managing system resources.
       *Often used for specialized tasks like AI or scripting.
Examples:

   *SQL – For databases.
   *MATLAB – For mathematical computations.

##Converting high-level code to low-level code is essential for making programs run directly on hardware.
This process is called compilation or interpretation. Here's why and how it works:

-Why Convert High to Low-Level Code?

*Execution – Computers only understand machine language (binary). High-level code must be translated for the CPU to execute it.

*Performance – Low-level code is faster and more efficient because it directly controls hardware.

*Optimization – Translating to low-level code allows the program to be optimized for speed and memory usage.

*Portability – High-level languages are written once and compiled to run on different machines (Java, for example).


How It Works (The Process):
1.Compilation (For Languages like C, C++)

*A compiler translates the entire high-level code into low-level code (machine code) at once.

Example:
For=c 
int x = 10;  // High-level code

Becomes machine code:
For php=
10110000 00001010  (in binary)

2.Interpretation (For Languages like Python, JavaScript)

*An interpreter translates and executes the code line by line.

Example:
For python=
print("Hello")  # Python code
Interpreter runs it directly without producing separate machine code.

3.Assembly (For Direct Low-Level Control)

*High-level languages can be compiled to assembly language before turning into machine code.

Example:
For assembly
MOV AX, 10  ; Assembly code

###Example Flow:
-Python Code (High-Level)

for python=
x = 5 + 3

-Assembly (Mid-Level)
assembly
MOV AX, 5
ADD AX, 3

-Machine Code (Low-Level)

10101010 00000101
00000101 00000011
